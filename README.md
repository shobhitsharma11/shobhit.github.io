## Summary

Highly accomplished and seasoned Software Engineering Leader with nearly two decades of experience across Fintech, Retail, E-commerce, and CRM. I specialize in AI/ML Solution Architecture, large-scale system design, and digital transformation. My expertise is in architecting, developing, and deploying cloud-native, scalable, and high-performance ML/AI solutions on GCP/AWS/PCF.

I have a demonstrated track record of driving complex technical projects, optimizing code for efficiency and performance, and providing technical guidance within high-stakes environments. I am adept at leveraging AI/ML frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras) and MLOps tools (Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform) to deliver impactful results and innovate with emerging technologies like Generative Al and LLMs.

## Career Highlights

* **Impactful AI/ML Implementations & Proactive Innovation:** Contributed to internal programs involving Machine Learning and AI, including the GME MLOps pipeline and test case generation from RAG implementation. I have actively participated in internal/external hackathons, exploring innovative product concepts and leveraging AI for diverse applications, including a pending patent for an "AI-powered career mentor framework". I have also motivated team members through consistent participation and recognition in hackathons.
* **Large Scale Business Growth & Cloud Transformation:** Architected, designed, and deployed a new Consented Data Services platform on GCP, estimated to bring in $7M+ in revenue every year. I also transformed multi-million-dollar platforms (e.g., 65+ applications) to GCP cloud with zero disruptions by using different strategies.
* **Security Leadership & Operational Efficiency:** Retired hundreds of on-premise infrastructure components, saving the company millions in costs while removing over 3K+ security vulnerabilities. I built internal/external self-support applications, reducing OPEX expenditure ($20K each quarter with FinOps insights) and achieving a 20% reduced MTTR through optimized monitoring tools like DataDog and Stackdriver alert.
* **Leadership Recognition & M&A Integration:** Recognized as a finalist for the "Emerging Leader of the year" award by Technology Association of Georgia (TAG) for demonstrating impactful and innovative leadership. I also drove the integration of acquired companies (Teletrack, DataX) into the Equifax ecosystem, and generated ~$25M in revenue growth.
